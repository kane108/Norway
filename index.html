                <img src="" alt="">
                <p>This city was so important in Medieval times, it was the Norwegian capital for two centuries. These days, it is the country's second-largest city filled with cultural attractions and beautiful scenery. Bryggen Hanseatic Wharf (Tyskebryggen), for instance, is a lovely mix of food and culture owing to the district's restaurants and old-school workshops. The Hanseatic Museum and Schøtstuene, meanwhile, showcase 18th-century weapons and other artifacts. For lovers of the quirky artwork of Edvard Munch, KODE3 is their best bet.
